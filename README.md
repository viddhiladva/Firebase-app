#Firebase-app

This is my first database-related project, which I created using JavaScript and Firebase.

This web app can be considered as a mobile app as well. as soon as you add this specific application to your home page, it will function just like a mobile app. 

This website is like a to-do list. You only need to add the item, After finishing your work, you can erase it simply clicking on it.
